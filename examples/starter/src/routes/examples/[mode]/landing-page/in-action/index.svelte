<h2>Inline Pages in Action</h2>
<p>
    Wondering how Inline Pages work in a real-world scenario? This page is built using
    inline pages. Every section is a separate page, and the navigation is handled by
    Routify. The result is a seamless browsing experience, with no page reloads or
    interruptions. The tabbed window below also uses inline pages.
